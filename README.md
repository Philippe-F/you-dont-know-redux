In React you have components which have their own state. For example, if you have a form that form will have state that holds the value of each field ( API request data is also stored in state). When you have a large application with a lot of different components. managing	individual component state is very difficult and that is where Redux (or any state manager) comes in. In Redux, instead of component level state you get application level state as a one way data flow. State is immutable, it comes from the top down; you donâ€™t change it, you recreate or reassign it.
